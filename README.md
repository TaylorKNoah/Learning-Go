# Learning-Go
In this repo I am working through Nomad Coders tutorial on the GO language.  
I have seperated the individual mini-projects into seperate folders  

What I learned to do in Go in each project:

Bank
 - structs
 - function vs method
 - method reciever
 - Private data in a struct
 - returning multiple data and data types from a function/method


Dictionary:
 - Types
 - The map type
