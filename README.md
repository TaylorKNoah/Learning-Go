# Learning-Go
Updated: 04/14/21  

In this repo I am working through Nomad Coders tutorial on the GO language.  
It is currently free at the [Nomad Coder's Website](https://nomadcoders.co/go-for-beginners/lectures/1712) if you create an account (also free). 

What I concepts I learned in Go from each project:

Bank:
 - Structs
 - Function vs method
 - Method reciever
 - Private data in a struct
 - Returning multiple data and data types from a function/method


Dictionary:
 - Types
 - Maps
 - Error handling
 - Catching only the function returns I care about
 - User input
